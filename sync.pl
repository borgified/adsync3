#notes
#
#ITRPT 
#has email (but not 100% reliable)
#has EID
#has data that is used to overwrite AD attributes like title, manager, etc
#
#AD
#has email (official email)
#
#
#before anything else, we need to establish a relationship between dn, email,
#and name so that the manager field can be filled in (it accepts dn only)
#
#email and name should come from ITRPT and dn can be obtained from AD
#store these 3 items on the same row in a database so it can be searched later.
#
#
#main program loop
#
#parse a line of ITRPT
#find the email
#look for the account in AD based on email
#compare attributes in ITRPT vs ones in AD, if different, ITRPT overwrites AD
#
#if email isnt found, this is an error. possible causes:
#email account not created
#typo in AD
#typo in ITRPT
#
#
#added features
#
#some people have preferred names, use preferred names when updating AD
#
#create an output file of emails of accounts successfully processed in
#case the script needs to be run again after an interruption and can just
#pick up from where it left off.
